# Analysis-of-GMO-crops-adoption-in-the-US

The data analyzed ranges from 2000 to 2020 and contains information on genetically modified wheat, cotton and soybean crops, one strain to resist the presence of bacteria and insects, the second to better resist herbicides.

From the analysis of the data I found that the states with the lowest adoption rate of these crops were all southern states with the exception of California.

A second rather curious discovery concerns the almost vertical drop in the adoption rate of genetically modified maize in 2012-2013, not to resume with an upward trend.

The adoption of cotton, on the other hand, is less pronounced than that of corn, but still falling over the years.

Soybean, however, shows a diametrically opposed behavior to both: its adoption begins slightly later, however, the curve shows an exponential trend to settle towards 80-90% adoption in the fields involved in the cultivation of genetically modified seeds.
