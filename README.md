# Analysis-of-GMO-crops-adoption-in-the-US

GMOs are living beings that have had their genetic code changed in some way. While conventional breeding, which has been going on for centuries, involves mixing all of the genes from two different sources, producing a GMO is much more targeted. Rather than crossing two plants out in the field, they insert a gene or two into individual cells in a lab. Yet, as mentioned earlier, GM technology can also be used on microorganisms. 

For example, bacteria have been genetically modified to produce medicines that can cure diseases or vaccines that prevent them. A commonly used medicine that comes from a genetically modified source is insulin, which is used to treat diabetes, but there are many others.

The data analyzed ranges from 2000 to 2020 and contains information on genetically modified wheat, cotton and soybean crops, one strain to resist the presence of bacteria and insects, the second to better resist herbicides.

From the analysis of the data I found that the states with the lowest adoption rate of these crops were all southern states with the exception of California.

A second rather curious discovery concerns the almost vertical drop in the adoption rate of genetically modified maize in 2012-2013, not to resume with an upward trend.

The adoption of cotton, on the other hand, is less pronounced than that of corn, but still falling over the years.

Soybean, however, shows a diametrically opposed behavior to both: its adoption begins slightly later, however, the curve shows an exponential trend to settle towards 80-90% adoption in the fields involved in the cultivation of genetically modified seeds.

The geographical situation can be easily displayed and understood using a map built with PowerBI

The operation of data cleaning and a first visualization has been done using Python, Pandas and Matplotlib.
After the processing I used PowerBi to create interactive graphs including a map of the USA filtered by state and crops.
